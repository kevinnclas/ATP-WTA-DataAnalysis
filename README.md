## Introduction

The ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) ranking is used for male players, while the WTA (Women's Tennis Association) ranking is used for female players.  

The ATP and WTA rankings are based on a points system, where players accumulate points according to their results in the tournaments they enter. These rankings are calculated by taking into account the results of the last 52 weeks, and layers can therefore improve or lose their ranking according to their tournament results.

Halfway through the 2023 season, the next meeting will take place at Wimbledon, to kick off the grass-court season.

## Objective

This project is a small analysis on the current ATP & WTA-players ranking (July 2023). During of my analysis, I've come across some interesting facts that I'd like to share with you. You can find the article [here](https://kevinnclas.github.io/articles/atp-wta.html).  

Whether you're a fan of tennis or simply interested in data analysis, I hope this project will please you!
